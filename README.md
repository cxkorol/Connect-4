# Connect-4

## Requirments

- You are expected to build a GUI where two players can take alternate turns.
- The state should be saved, so if the page is reloaded the game can be continued.
- We all make mistakes, maybe we sneeze when we are about to place our disc, it
  should be possible to go back in time and make new decisions about where to
  place a disc.

## Start dev mode

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

## What can be improved in my opinion if I'll spend more time

- Git commit messages: I prefer to open one PR for one feature and have a good history with readable messages, but it's a test assignment with different things to do so I just omitted this rule a bit;
- Design can be more interactive (I was focused mostly on functionality);
- Utils can be covered by tests;
- GUI can be deployed on a server.
